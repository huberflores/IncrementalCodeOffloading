Mesh Offloading for Augmented Reality Applications
=============================================================

Developed at HKUST(The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) by [SyMLab](http://symlab.ust.hk/index.html).

This prototype explores the feasibility of using offloading in the construction of 3D objects for augmented reality applications. This prototype is not a framework, and just provides insights about the technique. Complete framework along with more details about the approach can be requested to the authors, and they may grant access to it.



Installation
============= 

- git clone https://github.com/huberflores/IncrementalCodeOffloading.git

- import into Eclipse

- Alternatively, maven can be use to create the apk as shown in ObjLoader_Server/
